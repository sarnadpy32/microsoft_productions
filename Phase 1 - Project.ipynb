    "&ensp;However, the number of movies contained within the data from Rotten Tomatoes was much smaller in size by comparison, and an even smaller number of those movies could be compared directly with the insights gained through my financial analysis.\n",
    "&ensp;This was because there was no column containing the title information for the movies, and any comparison to the financial analysis dataframes I created would have to be performed based purely on the even more limited `theater_date` column.\n",
